# LeapYear Kata
## description

- Nearly every four years is a leap year which has 366 days, as opposed to a common year, which has 365 in the Gregorian Calendar.
- Leap years are needed to keep our modern day Gregorian calendar in alignment with the Earth's revolutions around the sun.
- It takes the Earth approximately 365.242189 days – or 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds – to circle once around the Sun.
- This is called a tropical year, and is measured from the March equinox.
However, the Gregorian calendar has only 365 days in a year, so if we didn't add a leap day on February 29 nearly every four years, we would lose almost six hours off our calendar every year. After only 100 years, our calendar would be off by around 24 days!

## Instructions

- Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not.
- A leap year is defined as one that is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
- For example, 2001 is a typical common year and 1996 is a typical leap year, whereas 1900 is an atypical common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.
